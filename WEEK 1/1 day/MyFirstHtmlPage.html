     <h2>The lions</h2><hr>
     <p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests.<br>
      It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at<br>
      twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and<br>
      composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when<br>
      hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe.</p>
